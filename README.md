This is my learning journal whilst devloping my skills to program. 


13/10/2025
I have just created a Github repository. This is not my first time ever performing this task however Github is still very much new to me. 

15/10/2025
Planning how I want to submit my assignments, this components term has confused me on what it actually means. All my classmates keep saying different things, will have to ask Paul.

16/10/2025
I have figured it out now. Very different, dare I say unusual. Each component means gameobjects essentially that perform certain tasks,
I have to place each of these in a separate object then include them all into one and show how they work.

17/10/2025
Working on the first component now. The component is a moving platform that moves between points.

20/10/2025
Next component: Made a script that allows the player to move on all the axis. The cube will be made into a character on the final project with all the components together.

25/10/2025
Taking this time to practice more personal projects and learn more about programming c# and unity. Will get back to this assignment shortly. 

1/11/2025
Platform-controller component: I've made a gameobject that controls another gameobject. This is essentially the controller that changes colour, 
depending on the colour the platform will either be visible or entirely disappear from the player.
I struggled a lot to decide how I wanted to go ablout implementing this idea but in the end I managed to get it to work. It will be very useful for the prototype to work.


Danger component: This is my 4th component that I need to complete the assignment. When the player touches this gameobject, they will be destroyed instantly. Not much of a struggle here, just learning more basic functions within unity
and learning more about what components actually make things possible. In this case colliders were very useful to execute this task, there are so many options to use but I chose oncollsionenter in this case rather than ontriggereneter
like I was tempted to pick earlier.


5/11/2025
Super speed component: extra component but this is my final component, I have definetly struggled with this one the most. Using coroutines with IEnumerator interface has been a very new process for me. 
I've taken this time to learn about what enumerators truly are as well as interfaces and how to implement each one for the specific purpose I want. All the components are now done. Next is to finish my prototype with them.
For now, I will take a much needed break from this assignment and continue it again when I have done more work on the other ones.


28/11/2025
The prototype is now finished, there are obstacles that can kill the player instantly, the super speed component, the platform controller as a hazard for the player and the movement script enables the player to move efficiently. 
My third person mannequin character was made and rigged by myself in blender. This process was new to me. 
I then animated them running but felt I was wasting too much time so I took my model to mixamo ( https://www.mixamo.com/#/ ) and assigned an idle, walking and running animation to my rigged model. I'm just going to test it out more
and check for any possible bugs before submitting.


2/12/2025 
Although everything is done, github is still very strange to me and I have lost work entirely whilst trying to share projects in the past on it so I am taking this time to learn it to the best of my ability before submitting anything.
The deadline is still quite a bit away so I should be perfectly fine. If anything, I trust Paul will guide me through the process. 

19/12/2025
Today will be the day I attempt to finish everything for the holidays so I will go in for assistance since Paul is in today and hopefully submit all of my programming assignment.
I have now recorded the final video with all the prototypes.
